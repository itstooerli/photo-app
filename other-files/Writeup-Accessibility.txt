(2) No, not all accessibility problems are solvable. Photos could have contrast issues
and could still have ambiguously worded alt text and/or captions.

(3) Yes, the website should be usable without CSS. Image alt text and button labels are 
still applied in the HTML. All text stylings should be removed and defaulted to the 
original black text. The website certainly won't look as nice, but it should still functional.
The only concern may be the font sizes are too small, but the HTML default should be
sufficient for most cases.

(4) Yes, the website should still be usable without the images since the text stylings should still
be accessible, the buttons and link should/will work, all users are accommodate with their username,
and users can still react to captions. The website would certainly lose its purpose without images, though.
