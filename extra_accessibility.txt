Were React's compilation warning/error messsages helpful?

Did React's compilation warning/error messages prompt you to consider making your site more accessible?
-- Sure. It more suggested me to clean up my code better.

What did you do to try to solve them?

-- I used the WAVE extension to check for accessibilty issues.
-- Most of the issues were alt text and contrast issues, so they were fairly straightforward.
